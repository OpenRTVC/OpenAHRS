# OpenAHRS

# Overview
OpenAHRS is an open-source project that provides a collection of functions for Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS) algorithms. The project is written in C and provides functionalities for quaternion manipulation, matrix operations, and raw sensor measurements processing.
